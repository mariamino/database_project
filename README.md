# Database Project:

## Objective:

Create a new SQL Database and nurture it with data.


## Steps:

### Think:
- Look at the data from the 7 csv files
- Understand the relations between the different csv files
- Identify the data that has to be cleaned

### Clean the data from the csv:
- open the csv in python
- check the metadata of the data
- downcast the data so the df takes up less memory and its faster to process
- Check and process null values to convert them into workable data.
- Check if there are duplicated values
- Save to a new csv


### Create the SQL Dataframe:
